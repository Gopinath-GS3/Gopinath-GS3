### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Gopinath Soundarrajan

I am passionate about pursuing a career as a Tester or Programmer because I am seeking a challenging position in a progressive organization that can make use of my abilities, such as problem- solving and attention to detail, while also providing opportunities for personal and professional growth. My educational background in Computer Engineering has equipped me with a solid foundation, and I am currently enrolled in a bootcamp course focused on Cyber Security Fundamentals to further expand my knowledge in this field. Furthermore, my hands-on experience as a Graphic Designer and Automotive tester adds value to my skill set. It enhances my ability to create user-friendly interfaces and design secure systems, making me well-rounded in both design and technical aspects.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Cyber Security Fundamentals in HyperionDev bootcamp funded by United Kingdom Department opf Education.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m a Graphic designer and now looking for field change into coding and development.

My Skill Set:
* Languages: Python, JavaScript, C, C++, HTML, CSS and UNIX shell Scripting 
* Database Knowledge: SQL 
* Adobe Creative Suite: Illustrator, Photoshop and InDesign 
* Design tool: Figma 
* MS Office: Word, Presentation, Excel
